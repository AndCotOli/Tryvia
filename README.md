# Tryvia

## Project Description
Get random questions asked in Trivia games and try to answer them. What will be your max streak?

## What is your motivation for creating this project?
I've always liked question games, and what a best way to prove it than building an online clone of Trivia?

## How will users interact with your web site?
Once the game has started, the app will display a random trivia question, and they can choose between the 2/4 possible asnwers.
20 seconds will be given to the users for answering one question.
Questions will become harder each time, and users will try to get the highest streak they can. If they fail one, the game ends.

I also plan to add a 'practice' mode, where users can choose different trivia categories and difficulties.

## What 3rd Party API(s) will you integrate with?

* [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)

## Tech Stack

* Vanilla JS and Bulma Css
* Cypress

## Will you try to implement any stretch features?

* Linter
* UI Animations
* CSS Flexbox
* Persistance
* State management
* JSDoc
* E2E
* PWA
* CI/CD
* Build Process

I'll try to implement as much as I can, if time allows.

## What will be your process?

* **Project Planning:** GitHub Projects.
* **Commits:** Every time I make any changes to the code.
* **Testing:** With an E2E testing, probably Cypress.
* **Wireframing/Mockups:** I'll use Adobe XD.
